==================

# How to deploy to Maven Central?

#### Snapshots
Automatically deployed by Travis, after a successful build of the _master_ branch.

#### Releases
Travis will perform a release each time a version tag (i.e. a tag named following [Semantic Versioning spec](http://semver.org/)) is found, so the developer should only prepare the release on his/her machine. The steps are:

```bash
mvn --batch-mode release:clean release:prepare
# If you want to manually set the version, remove the --batch-mode option

git push --follow-tags
# This will publish both the commits and the new tag
```
